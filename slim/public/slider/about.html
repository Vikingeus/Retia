        <h1>About me <small>Who the hell I'm?</small></h1>
        <p>Age? thats boring, let's talk about how big asshole am I. So, I kinda like depression, sadism, masochism, exorcism, and other bad "isms". It's so much fun to disturb other so that's why I do it like I do.</p>
        <p>Oh also, I like alcohol! And other bad stuff so I can be rebelious, everything that's bad is good for me, don't you think?</p>
        <p>But more serious, I'm 19y/o boy, metalhead, but I also like other generes like classical music, sometimes electro music and others but very rarely. My biggest hobby is all around computers, programming, graphics, building and modding. I'm also very much into lyric.</p>
